# TwitterMiniProject
App that detects whether a user is a bot or not as well as sentiment of their last 100 tweets. In order to test the app, run the botandsentiment.py file. This will require the user to enter a valid Twitter handle, which will then return the botometer score as well as the subjectivity, polarity, and overall sentiment of the last 100 tweets from the Twitter handle entered. 
The result should look like this with @elonmusk as an example:
